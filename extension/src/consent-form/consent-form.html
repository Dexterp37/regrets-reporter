          <p>In order to achieve this, we need to collect and analyze data about YouTube usage statistics. We would like to confirm that you are willing to share this information with us. Data collection will happen in the background while you use Firefox to browse YouTube.</p>
          <p><strong>Participation in the study is strictly voluntary.</strong></p>

            <li>The study add-on will collect varying information about your YouTube browsing behavior, possibly including what YouTube pages you visit and how you interact with them.</li>
            <li>Periodically, we will send aggregated information about your YouTube browsing behavior to Mozilla. </li>

          <p>Mozilla understands the sensitivity of the data that is collected and works hard to keep your data private and secure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>This data will be linked to a randomly generated ID we only use for this particular study. It is used to keep a specific user&#39;s data together on the server and helps us improve our analysis.</li>
            <li>No data will be collected from inside Private Browsing windows.</li>
            <li>Individual data will never be shared publicly or sold. Only a small number of researchers will have access to raw data. If we share aggregate information from the study, we will disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of participants being identified.</li>

          <h2 class="program-header">You Help Make The Internet Healthier</h1>
          <p>At Mozilla, we pride ourselves on making the internet healthier for you, the user! That’s why we need your help.</p>
          <p>YouTube is one of the most opaque platforms on the market, providing researchers and the public with very little data to study widespread user-reported problems with harmful content on the platform and draw attention to them in an evidence-driven way. Mozilla has already brought these concerns forward with YouTube and pressured the company to release more data to researchers who are trying to understand what content is amplified and pushed down by YouTube’s recommendation algorithms. </p>
          <p>By participating in this study, you will help us to make better decisions on your behalf and shape the future of the Internet!</p>
